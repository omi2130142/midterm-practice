Recycling is the reprocessing of the wastes to get a new product. The wastes are generating more and more every year concerning the increase of population. The wastes are not only dangerous to the environment and the natural resources, but also it is very dangerous to human health.

    <p1><i>the Recycle Bin is a system icon. Folders and files are not permanently erased when we remove them. Instead, they are relocated to the Recycle Bin from their original position. This allows us to retrieve files and directories that we may have erased by accident.

        In every version of Microsoft Windows since Windows 95, the Recycle Bin is an area where deleted files or folders are temporarily saved. Users can retrieve files that have been deleted in Windows by using the Recycle Bin. It’s on my computer’s desktop.</p1>
