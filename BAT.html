    <p class="shrikhand-regular">in 1902, BAT is a leading consumer goods business. Our corporate purpose is to create A Better Tomorrow™. For us, this means Building a Smokeless World and becoming a predominantly smokeless business by 2035. By providing smokers with access to smokeless products, we can drive forward Tobacco Harm Reduction and, ultimately, make cigarettes a thing of the past.</p>

    <p>We are a leading FTSE company with truly international credentials. Spread across six continents, our regions are the United States of America; Americas & Europe (AME); and Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa (APMEA).

        There are about 50,000 BAT people worldwide.
         
        
        Many of us are based in offices, factories, tech hubs and R&D centres. Lots of us, though, also spend our time out on the road, helping and advising tobacco farmers and the retailers who sell our products; both valued partners who have always played a major part in our success.
        
         
        
        Our heritage – and the foundation of our success – is in cigarettes. However, we recognise the world is changing. We have a clear corporate purpose to create A Better Tomorrow™ by Building a Smokeless World. A world where smokers have migrated from cigarettes to smokeless alternatives. A world where smokers make a ‘Switch to Better.</p>
