    <p class="gochi-hand-regular"> Motor Corporation has decided to close the plant of its automobile subsidiary in Thailand, Suzuki Motor (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter “SMT”) by the end of 2025. This decision was made as a part of reviewing Suzuki’s global production structure.

        Following the announcement of the eco-car project by the Thai government in 2007, Suzuki applied for the project and established SMT in 2011, after receiving approval of the project. The automobile plant started its production in 2012, and produced as much as 60,000 units annually including exports. Meanwhile, in the course of promoting carbon neutrality and electrification globally, Suzuki had been considering optimizing global production sites within the group. Consequently, we decided to close SMT plant by the end of 2025.
        
        Even after the closing of its plant, SMT will continue its sales and after-sales services to meet the customer needs in Thailand, through importing CBUs from plants within the ASEAN region as well as Japan and India.
        Also, in order to contribute to achieving carbon neutrality goals promoted by the Thai government, the company will introduce electrified models including hybrid vehicles.</p>

        <p><i> A ground-breaking project to realise a hydrogen fuel cell Hilux pick-up has moved into its next and final phase, signalling yet another milestone in Toyota’s progress towards a zero-carbon future.

            Since the unveiling of the first prototype vehicle in September 2023, Toyota and its consortium partners, supported by UK Government funding, have reached an intensive evaluation and demonstration stage.
            
            The latest landmark in this joint development project further demonstrates the broad scope of Toyota’s multi-path strategy towards carbon neutrality, applying different powertrain solutions – hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric, battery electric, fuel cell electric and e-fuels – to suit different user needs and local infrastructure.
